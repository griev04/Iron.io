            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>
                You are a small cell in a wild petri dish filled with fearless rival cells.<br>
                Survival is your objective.<br>
                Hunt cells smaller than you but flee from bigger ones or you will become an easy snack.<br>
                You may also try to bait opponent cells by ejecting part of your mass but beware of traps: you will loose all your precious mass in a blink of an eye.<br>
                <strong>Good luck, you will need it!</strong>
